Reasoning Core Development Guide
===============================

CURRENT STATUS:
- Basic chain-of-thought implementation exists in src/reasoning/core.scm
- Record types: reasoning-step, reasoning-chain defined
- Functions: chain-of-thought, apply-reasoning implemented

PRIORITY TASKS:
1. Enhance problem decomposition algorithms
2. Improve consistency verification methods
3. Add more reasoning patterns (causal, comparative, mathematical)
4. Implement step validation and error detection
5. Add confidence calculation improvements

KEY FUNCTIONS TO WORK ON:
- decompose-problem: Make it more sophisticated
- verify-consistency: Add deeper logical checks  
- identify-reasoning-type: Expand pattern matching
- calculate-confidence: Use more factors

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Must work with inference.scm for scaling
- Should integrate with text-gen.scm for output
- Needs evaluation metrics from experiments/

NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Read current core.scm implementation
- Identify gaps in reasoning patterns
- Add new reasoning step types
- Improve error handling and validation
