Inference Scaling Development Guide
===================================

CURRENT STATUS:
- Self-consistency, beam search, Monte Carlo methods implemented
- Temperature sampling and verification methods exist
- Basic voting and aggregation functions working

PRIORITY TASKS:
1. Optimize beam search performance and accuracy
2. Enhance Monte Carlo simulation quality
3. Improve voting strategies (weighted, ranked)
4. Add parallel processing for multiple chains
5. Implement advanced verification methods

KEY FUNCTIONS TO WORK ON:
- beam-search-reasoning: Better pruning strategies
- monte-carlo-reasoning: More sophisticated simulation
- weighted-voting: Implement confidence-based weights
- verify-reasoning-step: Add semantic consistency checks

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- Self-consistency: >80% agreement on correct answers
- Beam search: 3x better than greedy search
- Monte Carlo: Stable results with 100+ simulations
- Response time: <5s for complex reasoning

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Uses core.scm reasoning chains
- Provides results to evaluation framework
- Should work with Ollama integration

NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Profile current performance bottlenecks
- Add caching for expensive operations
- Implement parallel chain generation
- Test scaling with larger beam widths
