Evaluation Framework Development Guide
======================================

CURRENT STATUS:
- Comprehensive metrics dashboard implemented
- 6 core metrics: accuracy, coherence, completeness, efficiency, consistency, verbosity
- Visualization system with 12-panel dashboard
- Basic benchmark problems created

PRIORITY TASKS:
1. Expand benchmark problem database (target: 100+ problems)
2. Add domain-specific evaluation metrics
3. Implement cross-model comparison framework
4. Create automated testing pipeline
5. Add real-time performance monitoring

KEY AREAS TO EXPAND:
- Mathematical reasoning benchmarks
- Logical reasoning test cases  
- Common sense reasoning problems
- Multi-step reasoning challenges
- Edge case detection

METRICS TO ADD:
- Reasoning depth analysis
- Step necessity scoring
- Logical validity checking
- Cross-consistency verification
- Performance regression detection

INTEGRATION TARGETS:
- Real-time evaluation of Guile reasoning chains
- Comparison with Ollama model outputs
- Integration with CI/CD for quality gates
- Export to multiple formats (JSON, CSV, plots)

NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Create 20 new benchmark problems
- Add domain-specific metrics
- Implement automated test running
- Set up performance regression alerts
