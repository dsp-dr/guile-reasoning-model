Ollama Integration Development Guide
====================================

CURRENT STATUS:
- Basic Ollama client implemented with connection checking
- Real-time reasoning visualization system working
- Model comparison framework exists
- Live demo capabilities functional

PRIORITY TASKS:
1. Add streaming response support for real-time updates
2. Implement advanced model comparison metrics
3. Add automatic model selection based on problem type
4. Create Ollama-Guile reasoning chain integration
5. Implement caching for expensive model calls

KEY FEATURES TO ADD:
- Streaming generation with progress updates
- Model performance profiling and selection
- Reasoning chain validation against LLM outputs
- Batch processing for multiple problems
- Error handling and retry logic

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- Connection reliability >99%
- Streaming latency <100ms
- Model switching time <2s
- Cache hit rate >60%
- Error recovery rate >90%

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Compare Guile reasoning with LLM reasoning
- Use LLM outputs to validate Guile chains
- Hybrid reasoning: LLM + Guile combination
- Real-time dashboard updates

QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:
- Better prompt engineering for reasoning
- More sophisticated result parsing
- Enhanced error detection and handling
- Model-specific optimization

NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Implement streaming API calls
- Add model performance benchmarking  
- Create hybrid reasoning pipeline
- Test with multiple Ollama models
