   - Chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Problem decomposition
   - Consistency verification

2. **Text Generation** (`src/generation/`)
   - Tokenization
   - Sampling strategies
   - Caching mechanisms

3. **Evaluation Framework** (`src/evaluation/`)
   - Metrics implementation
   - Benchmark suite
   - Performance profiling

4. **Inference Scaling** (`src/inference/`)
   - Self-consistency
   - Beam search

### Experiments
- 10 comprehensive experiments covering all aspects
- Performance comparisons
- Ablation studies
- Real-world applications

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] All book chapters implemented in Guile
- [ ] Performance within 2x of Python reference
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for large-scale reasoning
- [ ] Integration with at least 3 Ollama models

### Quality
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Documentation coverage 100%
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Response time < 1s for simple reasoning

### Community
- [ ] Clear contribution guidelines

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Guile performance limitations**: Use FFI for critical paths
- **Ollama integration issues**: Provide fallback implementations
- **Memory constraints**: Implement streaming and chunking

### Schedule Risks
- **Book updates**: Maintain version compatibility
- **Dependency changes**: Pin critical dependencies
- **Scope creep**: Strict milestone boundaries

## Dependencies

### External
- GNU Guile 3.0+
- Ollama (optional but recommended)
- POSIX-compliant system

### Internal
- Core reasoning module (foundation for all)
- Tokenizer (required for generation)
- Evaluation metrics (needed for testing)

## Communication

### Progress Tracking
- GitHub Issues for tasks
- Milestones for major releases
- Project board for visualization
- Weekly progress updates

### Documentation
- Code comments (comprehensive)
- API documentation (auto-generated)
- User guide (markdown)
- Developer guide (markdown)

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. Complete tokenizer implementation
2. Add CLI interface for testing
