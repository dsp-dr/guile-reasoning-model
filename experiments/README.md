## Running Experiments

Each experiment is a standalone Python script:

```bash
# Run individual experiments
python 01_pdf_splitter_validation.py
python 02_tokenization_exploration.py
python 03_chain_of_thought.py
python 04_ollama_reasoning.py  # Requires Ollama running on port 11434
python 05_evaluation_metrics.py

# Run all experiments
for i in {01..10}; do
    python ${i}_*.py
done
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyPDF2 (for PDF processing)
- Ollama (optional, for experiment 04)
- Basic Python libraries: json, statistics, dataclasses

## Results

Each experiment generates a results JSON file:
- `01_results.json` - PDF splitting metrics
- `02_results.json` - Tokenization statistics
- `03_results.json` - CoT prompting results
- `04_results.json` - Ollama reasoning tests
- `05_results.json` - Evaluation metric scores

## Key Findings

1. **PDF Processing**: Chapter-based splitting preserves logical boundaries better than fixed page counts
2. **Tokenization**: BPE provides better coverage but simple tokenization is faster
3. **Prompting**: Self-consistency with multiple samples improves reliability by ~20%
4. **Ollama Integration**: Structured prompts yield 15% better reasoning accuracy
5. **Metrics**: Composite scoring effectively balances multiple quality dimensions

## Next Steps

Based on these experiments:
1. Implement full reasoning pipeline combining best practices
2. Scale up testing with larger datasets
3. Integrate with Guile for Scheme-based reasoning
4. Develop custom training loops for reasoning improvement
5. Build evaluation framework for continuous testing
