* Design Decisions

** Why Guile?

- Exploring functional implementation of neural network concepts
- Leveraging Guile's macro system for DSL creation
- Integration with existing Guile ecosystem projects

** Architecture Mapping

| Book (Python/PyTorch) | Guile Implementation |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| torch.Tensor          | SRFI-43 vectors     |
| nn.Module             | Record types        |
| Autograd              | Manual gradients    |
| CUDA/GPU              | CPU only (for now)  |

** Challenges

1. No native tensor operations - using vectors
2. No automatic differentiation - manual backprop
3. Performance limitations - focus on algorithms

** Future Directions

- FFI bindings to NumPy/PyTorch
- Pure Scheme neural network framework
- Focus on symbolic reasoning aspects
